==============================
README - Scoar Board Simulator
==============================

SB.jar
======
This is a JAVA project, and I have provided source code as well as a ant build.xml script.

Steps to compile and run the program:

0. Make sure you have 'ant' utility installed before you can compile.
1. Issue 'ant build' command.
2. Issue 'ant build_jar' command.
3. Issue the 'simulator.sh' command. 
   - Please provide the required argument. Program will tell you. 
4. DO NOT TOUCH OR MODIFY OR REMOVE ANY OF THE FILE YOURSELF.

HOW to RUN:
===========
I have provided some sample configuration, input files in 'inputs' folder. You can start with following command.

  './simulator.sh ./inputs/prog1.txt ./inputs/memory.txt ./inputs/reg.txt ./inputs/config.txt result.txt'

IMP NOTE:
=========
I have provided the build script, it should compile on any of the Java compiler you have.

Ideally you will need Java version 1.7 or greater. The reason is I compiled and build it using 1.7. 

Features not implemented & Issues:
==================================
1. Patial implementation of Branching and Jumps.
2. Partial implementation of I and D cache.
3. Consecutive instruction having Structral Hazard gives incorrect cycles 
   - This is because of my design flaw. 
   - However, the basic scoreboard will work perfectly.

General
=======
1. Please use the simulator.sh file. 
2. There is no '.bat' file to execute this program on Windowa platform. Please make sure you run it on Linux or Solaris.
3. Again please make sure you have Java version 1.6 and above.
